Proof 1 by penpot. This proof proves that there is only one configuration that
leads to another, and that thus this cell auto is reversable.

A becomes B
B becomes A, unless next to an A: then it becomes 0
0 becomes 0, unless next to an A: then it becomes A
 
=========
 
All B must have come from an A at the same position
 
Then:   B came from A
 
---
 
if there is a 0, then:
    It was a 0 before without any A around
    It was a B with an A around
        If there was an A around, then at this moment there must be an B at the
            same position
        If there was an A around, then that A became B already
 
Then:   0 came from 0, unless it is next to a B: then it came from B
 
---
 
If there is a A, then:
    it was a B without an A around
        or rather, it was a B and at the moment there is no B around
    it was a 0 with an A around
        or rather, it was a B and at the moment there is a B around
 
Then: A came from B, unless it is next to a B: then it came from 0
=========
 
So, following the rules in reverse:
B becomes A
A becomes B, unless next to a B: then it becomes 0
0 becomes 0, unless next to a B: then it becomes B
 
Since the time-reversed rules are the same as the normal rules but with A and B
switched, and since the normal rules applied to any configuration leads to only
one configuration, then the time-reversed rules leads to only one
configuration: that is, there is only one configuration that led to the current
one.
