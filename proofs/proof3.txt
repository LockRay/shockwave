Proof 3 by Lock/LockRay. This proof demonstrates that conservation of momentum
exists for finite regular 1 dimensional graphs.

For a 1-dimensional regular graph (of order 2) with an arbitrary configuration
of states A, B and 0 on each vertex, let any sequence of neighboring A and
B-vertices of the form BA have a value of +1 and any of the form AB have a
value of -1.
The total sum of the values of BA and AB occurrences in a given configuration
of the graph is referred to as the momentum (p) of the configuration.

- For the sequence BAX, where X is an arbitrary state for the next vertext
over, in the next iteration:

0) for any value of X
B -> 0, since it neighbors A
A -> B, by definition

1) for X=0 
X -> A, since it neighbors A

2) for X=B 
X -> 0, since it neighbors A

3) for X=A 
X -> B, by definition

Case (1): BA0 -> 0BA, p1=p2=1 momentum is conserved
Case (2): BAB -> 0B0, p1=p2=0 momentum is conserved
Case (3): BAA -> 0BB, p1=1, p2=0 momentum is not conserved

Case (3) proves that there is no conservation for an arbitrary graph. However,
since we're considering regular graphs specifically, it follows that there
must exist a vertex to the right of X.

- For case (3) let Y be the next neighboring vertex past X such that 
BAXY = BAAY. In the next iteration:

3.0) for any value of Y
See (0) and (3)

3.1) for Y=0
Y -> A, since it neighbors X=A

3.2) for Y=B
Y -> 0, since it neighbors X=A

3.3) for Y=A
Y -> B, by definition

Case (3.1): BAA0 -> 0BBA, p1=p2=1 momentum is conserved
Case (3.2): BAAB -> 0BB0, p1=p2=0 momentum is conserved
Case (3.3): BAAA -> 0BBB, p1=1, p2=0 momentum is not conserved

We can iterate the same process with case (3.3), examining the next vertex to
the right of Y.
In the subcases 1 and 2 (where the rightmost vertex is in state 0 or B
respectively) the exact same scenario will happen, as there will always be a
neighboring A to the left. 
In subcase 3 (where the rightmost vertex is A) the same process can be repeated
for the next vertex to the right, leading to the same results.
Assuming the graph is finite, it is guaranteed that eventually a vertex will be
reached that is not in state A (in the extreme case that would happen when the
graph loops around to encounter the B to the right of the original sequence).

Therefore, for any finite regular graph of order 2 the total momentum is
conserved.
